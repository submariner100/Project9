# Project9
hacking-with-Swift Projects - Using Grand Central Dispatch
The code from Project7 was used in this lesson. Unfortunately the upload for this project9 loaded into github project7.
Lessons learnt - Grand Central Dispatch async() and the different level settings, performSelector(inBackground:) and 
performSelector(onMainThread:) and closures.
